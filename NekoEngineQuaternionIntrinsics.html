          <h1>Quaternions Intrinsics Optimisation</h1>
          <p>
              I'm currently a student at the SAE Institute of Geneva school in the Games Programming section. 
              We're currently working on a Game Engine and we had to work by a team of two people on the implementation 
              of basic things for the Game Engine.
              <br>
              <br>
              Here, I am going to present to you an optimization I implemented by myself on the current Engine.
              <br>
              <br>
              Quaternions are used to represent rotations. They’re based on complex numbers and aren’t easy to understand 
              intuitively. You rarely access or modify individual Quaternion components. You’d just take existing rotations 
              like the one in the transform and use them to construct new rotations. One of the main reasons we’re using 
              Quaternions is to avoid gimbal lock which is the loss of one degree of freedom in a rotation.
              <br>
              <br>

          <p>
              My task was to optimize their use as much as I could so I decided to optimize them by working with the Intel Intrinsics functions.
              <br>
              <br>
              Let’s have a look.
          </p>
          <h2>Quaternion</h2>
          <p>
              The basic implementation of the Quaternions looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code>
struct Quaternion
{
  float x;        //4 bytes
  float y;        //4 bytes
  float z;        //4 bytes
  float w;        //4 bytes
};
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
              The Quaternion contains 4 floats representing every values.
              <br>
              <br>
              For the optimization I implemented, I decided to take the Dot function that calculates the Dot Product of 2 Quaternions, as a reference 
              to test if it was working or not.
              <br>
              <br>
              So here’s how the Dot function of my Quaternion struct looks like:
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code>
static float Dot(const Quaternion& a, const Quaternion& b)
{
  return  a.x * b.x +
          a.y * b.y +
          a.z * b.z +
          a.w * b.w;
}
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
              The Dot function takes each value of the Quaternion a and the Quaternion b to calculate the Dot product and it returns a float.
              <br>
              <br>
              These are the most logical way someone would implement a Quaternion and a Dot Product. Now, let’s look at how I decided to optimize this calculus.
          </p>
          <h2>FourQuaternion</h2>
          <p>
              To optimize my code, I decided to create a new Struct called FourQuaternion. The idea here is that this structure will contain 4 Quaternions instead of one.
              <br>
              <br>
              Why am I doing that? Because instead of doing the calculus 4 times with a different Quaternion, I’ll be doing it only once by aligning each values of the Quaternions.
              <br>
              <br>
              Why 4 floats then? Because 4 floats use 4 bytes each and an xmm register can contain 16 bytes.
              <br>
              <br>
              The FourQuaternion structure looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code>
struct alignas(4 * sizeof(float)) FourQuaternion
{
  std::array<float, 4> x;       //16 bytes
  std::array<float, 4> y;       //16 bytes
  std::array<float, 4> z;       //16 bytes
  std::array<float, 4> w;       //16 bytes
};
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
              It contains an array of 4 floats for each values in the FourQuaternion.
          </p>
          <h2>Array of Structures of Arrays</h2>
          <p>
              I've decided to approach the problem by creating an AoSoA system.
              <br>
              <br>
              To stock the values of my FourQuaternions, I decided to use an Array of Structures of Arrays.
              <br>
              <br>
              Structures of Arrays are a layout separating elements of a structure into one parallel array per field. It makes it easier to use them by packing them into SIMD instructions. So I must create those first.
          </p>
          <div class="game_title"><img src="images/ScalarVsSIMD.png" width="800"/></div>
          <p>
              The reason why structures of arrays are better here is because the values will be aligned in code so it's much faster to load all values from memory in one block instead of going for each value and then aligning them.
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Aos Alignment: xyzwxyzwxyzwxyzw</li>
              <li>SoA Alignment: xxxxyyyyzzzzwwww</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              Every FourQuaternion will be stocked in an Array in the code, this is then an Array of Structures.
              <br>
              <br>
              So combining these two values, it creates an Array of Structures of Array.
          </p>
          <div class="game_title"><img src="images/FourQuaternionsAoSoA.png" width="600"/></div>
          <h2>Intel Intrinsics</h2>
          <p>
              To do the functions with these arrays, I’ll have to use the Intel Intrinsic instructions, which are C style functions that provide access to many Intel instructions without the need to write assembly code.
              <br>
              <br>
              Since I decided to use the Dot function as a test, let’s look at how it looks like in the FourQuaternion (here FourQuat) Struct:
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code>
static inline std::array<float, 4> Dot(const FourQuat& q1, const FourQuat& q2)
{
  alignas(4 * sizeof(float)) std::array<float, 4> result;
  auto x1 = _mm_load_ps(q1.x.data());
  auto y1 = _mm_load_ps(q1.y.data());
  auto z1 = _mm_load_ps(q1.z.data());
  auto w1 = _mm_load_ps(q1.w.data());

  auto x2 = _mm_load_ps(q2.x.data());
  auto y2 = _mm_load_ps(q2.y.data());
  auto z2 = _mm_load_ps(q2.z.data());
  auto w2 = _mm_load_ps(q2.w.data());

  x1 = _mm_mul_ps(x1, x2);
  y1 = _mm_mul_ps(y1, y2);
  z1 = _mm_mul_ps(z1, z2);
  w1 = _mm_mul_ps(w1, w2);

  x1 = _mm_add_ps(x1, y1);
  z1 = _mm_add_ps(z1, w1);
  x1 = _mm_add_ps(x1, z1);
  _mm_store_ps(result.data(), x1);
  return result;
}
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
              Let me explain what the Intel Intrinsics functions do:
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>ps</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              ps means packed single_precision floating-points. It basically means 4 * 32 bit floating point numbers stored as a 128-bit value.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>_mm_load_ps()</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              The _mm_load_ps function is loading from memory the values contained in the array. The values must be 16 bytes which correspond to an array of 4 float numbers, and they must be aligned in memory, that’s why we’re using arrays that align the floats in memory.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>_mm_mul_ps()</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              The _mm_mul_ps function is multiplying 4 floats with 4 other floats.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>_mm_add_ps()</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              The _mm_add_ps function is adding 4 floats with 4 other floats.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>_mm_store_ps()</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              The _mm_store_ps function is storing from the value x1 to the memory.
              <br>
              <br>
              Here, instead of calculating the Dot function 4 times with 4 different Quaternions, I’ll be calculating it only once. This will allow to spare a lot of performance as I will show you.
          </p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
              I created a test that calculates the Dot product of n Quaternions using the MSVC Compiler with an Intel core i7 CPU on a Windows 10 PC. Here’s the result:
          </p>
          <div class="game_title"><img src="images/PerfResults.png" width="600"/></div>
          <p>
              As you can see, the FourQuaternion Dot Produt is between 3 and 4 times faster than the Quaternion Dot Product which is a huge performance optimization.
              <br>
              <br>
              I've looked on Godbolt what was the main difference between the two functions in assembly code.
              <br>
              <br>
              The Quaternion Dot function had to use a jmp to test the Dot product of 4 Quaternions. It calculated for each value the Dot product.
              <br>
              <br>
              The FourQuaternion Dot function had no jump. Where the Quaternion Dot had to use movss (32-bit memory location) and movsxd functions, the FourQuaternion Dot is using movaps (128-bit memory location) 
              and movups functions. This shows us that we achieved to use the Intel Intrinsics functions correctly.
          </p>
          <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p>
              It was the first time for me to do that kind of exercise to optimize the most I could the code I implemented.
              <br>
              <br>
              It was the first time I worked with AoSoAs and with the Intel Intrinsics functions. It was really interesting to know what was going on with the compiler and what it was doing to try to optimize the code I was writing, and knowing that he couldn't guess everything.
              <br>
